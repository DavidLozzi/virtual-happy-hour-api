## Retired

I decided to retire this project, [learn more here](https://davidlozzi.com/my-apps/#vhh).

Back end for https://github.com/DavidLozzi/virtual-happy-hour

## Set up

Clone down this repo

Run `npm i`

Install [Redis](https://redis.io/).

Run redis server by running `redis-server`.

Run the API by running `npm run start`

This should run the API on `https://localhost`
